# Cookie extension

Chromium extension to help users understanding cookies on their computer and trackers on the web. It mainly analyzes cookies and trackers. In addition to passive actions (analysis), actives actions are provided to automatically help users (i.e.: cookies deletion).

## Features

Currently, all the features have to be developed. At this end of the project, we would like to have cookie analysis, tracker analysis, a popup and a management dashboard.

### Cookies

For each website, the extension analyzes all its cookies (including thoses for advertising, proper functioning, analytics...).

List of passives actions :
- Basic analysis: analyzing its attributes (domain, size, expiracy date...) and numbers of cookies stored,
- Classification: detecting the type of the cookie (advertising, analytics, proper functioning...).


List of actives actions:
- Automaticaly delete cookies from closed tabs,
- Clear cookies if unused for a long time,
- Block bad cookies.

### Trackers

TODO

### Popup

By clicking on the extension icon (on the top right of the browser), a small popup appear. Aggregated data (cookies and trackers "score") are shown to quickly understand if the visited website is "clean" or not. Links to more informations (for cookies and trackers related actions) can be clicked, in addition to an information button if the user wants to learn more about privacy.

### Dashboard

As the popup is too small to display all our explanations, a full page dashboard is provided. User is allowed to see statistics, to set parameters (i.e.: domain blocked / whitelisted for cookies and trackers), to read static information on privacy...

## Installation

TODO.
